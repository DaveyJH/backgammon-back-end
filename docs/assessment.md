# Assessment Guide

This assessment guide covers both the DRF back end and the React front end. Items that are not relevant to the back end have a strikethrough styling applied to them.

## Learning Outcomes

- [ ] ~~LO1 | Design an interactive Front-End web application using HTML, CSS and advanced JavaScript, based on component composition and separation of concerns.~~
- [ ] ~~LO2 | Explain the key role that specialist Front-End developers perform in modern software development/delivery teams.~~
- [ ] LO3 | Create an Application Programming Interface for consumption by 3rd party applications.
- [ ] ~~LO4 | Create an Interactive Front-End application that consumes API data.~~

## LO3 Create an Application Programming Interface (API) for consumption by 3rd party applications

- [ ] 3.1 | Build a Back-End for a Full-Stack web application that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.
- [ ] 3.2 | Design a database structure relevant for your domain, consisting of a minimum of TWO custom models (excluding user and profile models).
- [ ] 3.3 | Write Python code that is consistent in style and conforms to the PEP8 style guide.
- [ ] 3.4 | Include custom Python logic to demonstrate your proficiency in the language, e.g.: loops, if statements, DRF framework specific functions and classes.
- [ ] 3.5 | Include Back-End framework specific features, e.g., class-based/generic views, permissions, serializers.
- [ ] 3.6 | Develop the models (minimum two required) into a usable database where data is stored in a consistent and well-organized manner.
- [ ] 3.7 | Create a complete set of CRUD functionality for records in the API.
- [ ] 3.8 | Apply login and registration functionality.
- [ ] 3.9 | Users should not be permitted write access to restricted content or functionality.
- [ ] 3.10 | Implement manual testing and document the procedures and results in the README file for the Back-End application.
- [ ] 3.11 | Use Git & GitHub for version control of the Back-End application up to deployment, using commit messages to document the development process.
- [ ] 3.12 | Deploy a final version of the Back-End application code to a cloud-based hosting platform and test to ensure it matches the development version.
- [ ] 3.13 | Ensure the security of the deployed version of the Back-End application, making sure to not include any passwords in the git repository, that all secret keys are hidden in environment variables or in files that are in .gitignore, and that DEBUG mode is turned off.
- [ ] 3.14 | Document the deployment process for the API in the README file for the Back-End application.
