## Objective

This site is to represent capabilities with the Django Rest Framework. It should
employ full Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functionality via DRF.

The assessment checklist is available to view in the
[`docs/` directory](https://github.com/DaveyJH/backgammon-back-end/tree/main/docs)
of the project repository.

***The needs within this project are not genuine and are made purely for the
purpose of completing my Code Institute project.***

***

## Brief

### Tactical Rashers API

Tactical Rashers : a backgammon players' site. The site should allow users to
play backgammon in a manner similar to
["Chess by post"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_chess). Users
will be able to play private games, with dice rolls handled via the app, and
comment with their intended moves. They should be able to update the main image
of the game to the latest state of a board and should be able to declare a
winner.

Full CRUD functionality should be available to allow users to interact
appropriately with the various aspects of the finished application. This repo
intends to provide a robust back-end API via the Django Rest Framework.

***

## UX &#8722; User Experience Design

### User Requirements

Some example user stories that will affect the design. Please consult the
[GitHub project board](https://github.com/users/DaveyJH/projects/8/views/4) for
a full list.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of some of the user stories. These are the key
user stories that must be achieved for an MVP to be considered complete:

#### First Time User

> *"As a **potential player**, I would like to be able to **read the rules of
> the game** so that I **know how to play**"*
>
> *"As a **potential user**, I would like to be **able to create a profile** so
> that I **am able to play**"*

#### Returning User

> *"As a **returning user**, I would like to **quickly determine whether I am
> logged in** so that I can **log in / out as needed**"*
>
> *"As a **returning user**, I would like to **log in to my account** so that I
> can **interact with the features of the site**"*
>
> *"As a **returning user**, I would like to **view my currently active games**
> so that I can **track the progress of, and make new moves on, my games in
> play**"*
>
> *"As a **returning user**, I would like **to play a game with another
> player** so that I can **enjoy the game of backgammon**"*
>
> *"As a **returning user**, I would like **to comment on completed games** so
> that I can **interact with other users of the site**"*

***

### Initial Concept

The back-end API should provide robust, well-handled database management for the
front-end application. It should allow user authentication, game management,
dice rolling and winner tracking. An optional consideration of "Follow gamer" -
a feature that allows users to follow completed games of particular gamers - may
be considered dependent on time constraints.

## Database Model

A PostgreSQL database has been used for storing the various data required for
the API.

The database structure has been mapped out using an ERD diagram generated using
the [drawio](#vscode-extensions) extension in VSCode. Many of the entities will be linked
back through the owner (Django auth's `User` model) which allows the database to
have a straightforward structure.

## Technologies Used

### Other Tech

<!-- #### ScreenToGif -->

#### *[Windows Snipping Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots-00246869-1843-655f-f220-97299b865f6b)*

A screenshot tool built into Windows. It allows quick, partial screenshots
to be taken that can be saved as image files.

#### *[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)*

A free, streamlined code editor. The [extensions](#vscode-extensions)
available have allowed me to customize my workspace and become more
efficient.

## Development

The site was developed using [git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](#github) and
[VSCode](#vscode). The repository is available for cloning or forking but no
additional contributions will be accepted at this time.

To clone the repo please see the steps below.

### [GitHub](https://github.com)

- Sign in to GitHub.

![GitHub dashboard](./docs/assets/images/github-dashboard.png)

- Navigate to the repository at https://github.com/DaveyJH/backgammon-back-end,
  click **&#60;&#62; Code &#9662;** and copy the URL provided.

![GitHub dashboard](./docs/assets/images/clone-repo.png)

- Proceed to your chosen method of cloning a repo and provide the copied URL
  when needed.

### [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

I have a number of extensions installed to aid my development in VSCode. The
steps below work for me, but alternative methods are available. Please consult
the relevant docs for various approaches.

- Open a `bash` terminal within VSCode and navigate to a parent directory for
  your repository.

![bash terminal](./docs/assets/images/bash-terminal.png)

- Enter `git clone https://github.com/DaveyJH/backgammon-back-end.git` (the URL
  copied from GitHub). This will clone the repository into a new
  directory called `backgammon-back-end`.

![clone command](./docs/assets/images/clone-command.png)

- Enter the `cd backgammon-back-end code . -r` to open the repository in the
  current VSCode window.

![open in VSCode command](./docs/assets/images/cd-backgammon-back-end.png)

- Create and activate a virtual environment within the directory. I use `venv`
  for this via `python -m venv .venv && . .venv/scripts/activate`.

![venv creation and activation](./docs/assets/images/venv-creation-and-activation.png)

- Install the requirements for the repository using
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

![requirements installation]()

- Ensure you have created the necessary `env` variables in a `.env` file.
